## Configuration

Before running the app, you need to set up Firebase for authentication and storage. Follow these steps to configure Firebase:

1. Create a new project on the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. Enable Firebase Authentication and choose your preferred authentication method (e.g., email and password).

3. Set up Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore for storing university data. You can refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for more details on setting up Firebase services.

4. Once Firebase is configured, update the Firebase configuration in the app. Locate the `lib/services/firebase_service.dart` file and replace the placeholders with your Firebase project configuration.

## APIs

The University App uses the following API to fetch the list of universities:

- **GET** - `http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?country=India`

The API returns a JSON response containing information about universities in India. The app retrieves this data and displays it in the list view.
